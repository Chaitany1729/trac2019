#Spectral Analysis of Vela Pulsar 

This repository contains the spectral analysis of Vela Pulsar data. The data is provided by Ooty Radio Telescope (taken during CHERA 2015). The time interval between successive samples is inverse of 33 MHz, which is the Nyquist sampling rate for the 16.5 MHz wide spectral band down-converted from that at the centre frequency of 326.5 MHz. It contains two parts correspond to signals from the Northern half and the Southern half of the Ooty Radio Telescope, separately.

The analysis includes the study of the probability distributions of the collected voltage samples, dynamic spectrum and cross-spectrum for the same and detecting the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) affected channels and removing them. 

The analysis is done under the guidance of Dr Avinash Deshpande, RRI, Banglore as a part of training sessions for the SWAN imaging challenge.
