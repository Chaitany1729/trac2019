# The Radio Astronomy Club

#### The repository contains all the documentation about the technical tasks performed in The Radio Astronomy Club, BITS, Pilani.

The Radio Astronomy Club (TRAC) is a team of passionate undergraduate students working towards research in the interdisciplinary field of astrophysics. It is a unique blend of Astrophysics, Machine Learning, Electronics and Mathematics. Affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS, Pilani, we have been working on instrumentation and data analysis in the Radio and Gravitational Wave (GW) domains of Astrophysics.
